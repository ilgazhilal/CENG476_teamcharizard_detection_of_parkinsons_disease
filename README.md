matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn=0.22.2 #This version has to be specified. You should not use version 0.23.

##Dataset

Dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset link:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons
You do not have to download data. In the project, we requested dataset using urllib library from Internet.

##Environment
Python version is 3.7.10 and the environment is Google Colaboratory. You do not set up environment. Google Colaboratory runs entirely in the cloud. You should upload .ipynb file to Google Colaboratory.
